# Cypress Actions
Implementing GitHub Actions in a Cypress.io project empowers development teams to automate testing processes, improve code quality, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.

### Basic Approach
1. Run steps for set up and installation of cypress, our approach is to use an empty project
- You must add some example tests at this point
- Itâ€™s important that run some test cases 
2. Create a GitHub Action workflow File 
Inside your repository, create a directory named .github/workflows, if it doesn't exist already. Then, create a YAML file inside this directory. You can name it something like cypress-tests.yml.
3. Define workflow
```
name: Cypress Tests


on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main


jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Install npm dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
     
      - name: Run Cypress test
        run: npm run cypress:run
```
4. Configure Cypress Commands: Make sure your project's package.json file has the necessary scripts for running Cypress tests. For example:
```         
{
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:run": "cypress run"
  }
}
```
5. Commit and Push: Commit the changes to your repository and push them to GitHub. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to run your Cypress tests.
`git add .`
`git commit -m 'Actions implementation'`
`git push`

6. Monitor Workflow Execution: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow's execution. You should see the workflow triggered and the Cypress tests being executed.
7. Review Results: Once the workflow completes, review the results to see if your Cypress tests passed or failed. You can also set up notifications or integrate with other services to receive alerts on test failures.
